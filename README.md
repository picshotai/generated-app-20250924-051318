    This command starts the Vite development server for the frontend and the Wrangler development server for the backend worker simultaneously.
    ```sh
    bun run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üñ•Ô∏è Development

The project is structured as a monorepo with a shared core, a frontend application, and a backend worker.

*   `src/`: Contains the React frontend application. All pages, components, and client-side logic reside here.
*   `worker/`: Contains the Hono backend application that runs on Cloudflare Workers. API routes and Durable Object entity definitions are located here.
*   `shared/`: Contains shared TypeScript types and mock data used by both the frontend and the backend to ensure type safety.
